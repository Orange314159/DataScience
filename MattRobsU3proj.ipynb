        "Based on my final model, it appears that my subject is projected to sleep approximately normal distribution centered about 7.36hrs of sleep. The model also suggests that we will find the subjects sleep to fall between 2.298hrs and 12.564hrs 95% of the time. This supports my earlier guess that the distribution might be slightly right skewed as this range includes more to right of the mean. Looking at our \"one sigma\" we find that it extends 2.979hrs to the left and 2.730hrs to the right, suggesting that my original guess of 3 as the standard deviation was very close. My guess of 7 for a mean was somewhat close, but it was a little low which probably could have been corrected for by considering the time that the subject was not in school (on summer break)."
